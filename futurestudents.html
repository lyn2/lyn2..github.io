            <p>Thank you for your interest in working with me at the Department of Geography at the Texas State
                University. </p>
            <p>I am currently seeking Master or PhD students in the Fall of 2019 to work with me on several <a href="research.html"
                    target="_blank">research projects</a>. It is also highly encouraged to come with one's own interests and ideas to implement under my supervision and the supportive platform of the department.</p>

                <h3>Current opportunities</h3>
                <div class="container col-sm-8">
                    <p>I am looking for some graduate students to join my current ongoing research projects:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reconstruction of the Holocene glacial history in the central Tian Shan</strong></li>
                            <p>(The ideal candidate for this project is interested in working in the field at remote, high mountains, and can do laboratory work, such as crushing rocks and handling chemicals, and know some GIS and statistics.)</p>
                            <li><strong>Recent glacier status and changes (e.g. surface elevation, ice velocity, volume, etc.)</strong></li>
                            <p>(This work requires familarity of GIS and remote sensing techniques, in particular image classification, generation of DEM, feature-tracking, structure from motion, differencing DEMs and others. Geodetic measurements, fieldwork, and coding (e.g. Python) are preferred skills.)</p>
                            <li><strong>Past climate change using tree rings and meterological data</strong></li>
                            <p>(Lab-based analysis and geomatics/statistics/data visualization are required skills.)</p>
                        </ul>
                        More information regarding the research topics can be found at my <a href="research.html"
                            target="_blank">research</a> and <a href="publications.html" target="_blank">publications</a>.
                        I encourage you to read the pages carefully to make sure you are making an informed decision.
                        The glacier-based research will likely to be located either in Rocky Mountains of the
                        United States or Tian Shan ranges in China. The climate studies will be in the Texas area or the Southwest US.</p>
                    <p>I also welcome queries from prospective graduate students with their own research ideas, so
                        long as their research shares common topics with mine to a reasonable extent. However, if the gap
                        between my research and your interest is too big so that I will not be able to provide you the best advising you need, I will recommend other proper professor/s from our large group of faculty here at TXState to you with no reservation.<!--H. If this happens to be the case, I strongly recommend you to consider other 
			<a href="http://www.geo.txstate.edu/people/faculty.html" target="_blank">professors</a> in our
			department who might serve as a better advisor. We have a large group of professors here at Texas
		    State University doing research on a variety of topics, and I will not be surprised if you find someone
            whose research shares a greater common ground with your interest. --></p>
                    <p>I am committed to building an inclusive, productive, and diverse research group. I promise to treat everyone fairly and respectfully regardless of their ethnicity, color, socioeconomic background, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and age. I welcome interested applicants to contact me (y_l122@txstate.edu) with necessary information (see: <a href="futurestudents.html" target="_blank">Contacting me</a>). </p>

                    <p><strong>Texas State University has the biggest geography department in the United States.</strong>
                        The Department of Geography has been generous in terms of funding its students. The financial
                        support of students is usually in the form of teaching and/or research assistantships. On top
                        of that, the department offers a variety of <a href="http://www.geo.txstate.edu/resources/scholarships.html"
                            target="_blank">scholarships</a>.
                        Financial support is also available in the form of travel grants, to support students for their
                        field research as well as conference travels.</p>

                    <p>The Geography Department has abundant research resources, including physical geography, GIS, and
                        Remote Sensing lab space. These labs are equipped with state-of-the-art research equipments and
                        computers. The Geography Department has also been in close collaboration with other departments
                        on campus, as well as other universities in this region. <!--In the event we don't have something,
                        it is likely someone else at Texas State University or other sister universities does.--></p>

                        <h4>International students</h4>
                    <p>International students who want to apply our programs have to meet <a href="http://www.gradcollege.txstate.edu/international.html" target="_blank">the requirements from the graduate school</a> by providing required documents, including English proficiency test scores etc. Please also note that international applicants follow different deadlines than US domestic applicants. And, the departmental deadlines are at an ealier date in case you plan to apply assistantship.</p>
